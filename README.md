# coding_challenge-12

This month we are doing a special coding challenge! December is the best time of the year to be a programmer since the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) begins! Every day, we are going to have a programming problem that we all need to solve for 24 days straight. The beauty will be that you will be able to see your solution and compare it with all the other students of our community! **When it comes to problem solving, in my opinion, Advent of Code is the best resource avilable to make you a better logical thinker through code. I cannot recommend it enough if you want to become a better coder so I hope you can all participate even if it is just a few days**. 

## What is the Challenge?
Each day Advent of Code will give you a problem to solve. Each day, the questions get harder and harder. All you will need to do is to submit your code anytime you finish the question (Please note: Although each day is a new question, you can submit your code anytime and even do the questions anytime even if you miss the actual day)

### Here are the steps:
1. Read the about section here: https://adventofcode.com/2018/about
2. Watch **Santa's Node Helper** videos (Lecture 240, 241 and 242 in the Complete Web Developer in 2019 course) to see me solve one of these problems. *this is optional for those that have the course*
3. Start solving problems starting December 1st, 2018!
4. Submit your code and share it with the rest of our community every day by following the steps below:

## Matt and notAnkur's submission guide
Thanks to @Matt and @notAnkur, we have a great system in place for you to submit your daily code, and compare your answer to the rest of the students who will participate in the challenge. Here is how it will work and how you can see other submissions:
Matt and notAnkur, please fill this part. 


*** **Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I receive from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
